- Total Amount Received - Total amount repaid by borrowers.
- Average Interest Rate - Average interest rate across all loans.
- Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI) - Average DTI of borrowers.
  
## 2. Good Loan vs. Bad Loan KPIs:
- Good Loan KPIs -
Percentage and total of loans with a status of 'Fully Paid' or 'Current'.
